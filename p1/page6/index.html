	<h2>Jellyfish Evolution</h2>
	<p>The bell-shaped jellies—distantly related to corals and anemones—launched their lifestyle long, long ago. Exquisite <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2007/11/1/20050805/world-s-earliest-jellyfish-fossils-505m-years-old-found-in-w-utah">jellyfish fossils found recently in Utah</a> display reproductive organs, muscle structure and intact tentacles; the jelly fossils, the oldest discovered, date back more than 500 million years, when Utah was a shallow sea. By contrast, fish evolved only about 370 million years ago.</p>
